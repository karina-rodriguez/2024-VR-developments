Despite the many advances in computer graphics and the availability
of accessible hardware and tool kits for Virtual and Mixed Reality systems, 
multiple challenges are still present to its adoption.

Let's explore this in more detail.

::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::: challenge

Which have been the challenges for the widespread consumer adoption of Virtual Reality technologies in the last decade?

:::::::::::::::::::::::: solution 

A mixture of challenges are still present, try to order them:

- Accessible hardware - specialist kit can still be expensive.
- Headsets are often not wearable for longer periods.
- Natural interfaces, full immersion and presence is not yet possible.
- Systems are not interoperable - drives price of development upwards.
- Lack of available content beyond specialised content, e.g. games.
- Market  for headset is too segmented and saturated.
- Augmented Reality (AR) Competition

## Informing our approach

Understanding how to overcome these challenges is important for our
approach for building VR applications.

Hardware, sensors and wearables
and its processing power/graphics capabilities will continue 
to improve to create
more seamless and powerful interfaces.

As software developers it is important to consider
how to remove the barriers, such as:


- Enabling wider generation of MR/VR experiences, such as user-generated (e.g. [Engage](https://engagevr.io/)).
- Increasing the available content
- Fostering the interoperability of content and systems
- Further developing our understanding of immersiveness

For example, recent studies[^1] in immersiveness have shown that:


> The majority of studies have shown that ... realism has a positive impact on user experience ...

> Haptic stimuli are the most supported to improve the perceived environment realism.

> Some Realism Factors impacting user experience in IVEs, such as scent and taste, are still to be researched.

::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::: keypoints 

- Despite advances, key challenges still exist for realising the vision of VR.
- Challenges include easy content creation, interoperability and full immersion.
- Software developers can explore how to tackle some of these.
