The wide availability of VR/MR headsets have enable many applications in areas
such as education, medicine, construction.

Despite the many advances in computer graphics and the availability
of accessible hardware and tool kits for Virtual and Mixed Reality systems, 
multiple challenges are still present to its adoption.

Let's explore this in more detail.

::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::: challenge

Which have been the challenges for the widespread consumer adoption of Virtual Reality technologies in the last 40 decades?

:::::::::::::::::::::::: solution 

A mixture of challenges are still present, such as:

1. Accessible hardware - specialist kit which can be expensive.
2. Headsets are often not wearable for longer periods, need for
natural interfaces 
3. Lack of market, market is segmented
4. Lack of available content beyond specialised content, e.g. games.
5. Facilitating the development of experiences 
6. Interoperable systems
7. Full immersion and presence

## Informing our approach
Understanding how to overcome these challenges is important for our
approach for building VR applications.

Hardware and its processing power will continue to improve to create
more seamless and powerful interfaces.

As software developers it is important to consider
how to remove the barriers, such as:


- Enabling wider generation of MR/VR experiences, such as user-generated (e.g. [Engage](https://engagevr.io/)).
- Increasing the available content
- Fostering the interoperability of content and systems
- Further developing our understanding of immersiveness

For example, recent studies[^1] in immersiveness have shown that:



> The majority of studies have shown that ... realism has a positive impact on user experience ...

> Haptic stimuli are the most supported to improve the perceived environment realism.

> Some Realism Factors impacting user experience in IVEs, such as scent and taste, are still to be researched.

::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::: keypoints 

- Despite advances, key challenges still exist for realising the vision of VR.
- Challenges include easy content creation, interoperability and full immersion.
- Software developers can explore how to tackle some of these.
