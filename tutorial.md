## Introduction to Virtual Environments 

The aim of this tutorial
is to allow you to familiarise with the basic components of 
a Game Engines, the most popular development tools for VR.

### Create a basic 3D scene

Creating a 3D scene in a 3D environment is the first step to any VR/AR/MR development. In this tutorial explore the basics of creating a 3D scene, including its basic components (e.g. geometries, cameras and basic lighting). 

You don't need to worry about connecting to the VR headset yet. 

If you have previous experience creating
3D scenes, you can find previous projects
and see whether can port them to a newer
version or another game engine.

The basic steps to follow are as follows:

#### 1. Design the space

Design an environment, and think about the space and information you would like the user to experience. 

#### 2. Find some assets

Collect from the Internet images, sound, videos, and 3D models which you would need to deliver your 3D environment. 

You can access 3D assets either from the asset store or from the web including a 3D models/textures, and additional multimedia elements.

#### 3. Bring all your assets in the environment

Create the scene for your 3D environment. 
Try to march to your original idea by incorporating 3D models, as well as animations if this will help to bring some life to the environment.


#### 4. Develop simple interactions with the environment

Implement a set of simple interactions, e.g. such as tap an object to bring some information to the user. 

Consider which impact does it have to not have access to a mouse and keyboard on a VR environment both for navigating and accessing information.
